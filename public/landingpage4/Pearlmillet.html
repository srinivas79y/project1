              <p>
                Bajra is a traditional Hindi name for the Pennisetum glaucum crop —
also known as pearl millet.
242 It’s likewise known as dukn, cumbu, gero, sanio, kambu, babala, or bulrush millet.
243 The grain is primarily grown in Africa and India, where it’s a major source of
nutrition. However, it’s also grown and consumed in many other places around the world.
244 Bajra refers to the edible seeds of pearl millet plants. They grow in various shades of
white, yellow, gray, brown, and bluish-purple.
245 The seeds are typically cooked as a cereal grain or sometimes finely ground and used as
a flour.

                Vegetable Pearl Millet Recipe - Bajra Khichdi (One Pot Meal):
Bajra (Pearl Millet) Khichdi makes a perfect, diabetic friendly and healthy one pot
meal. Pearl Millet (Bajra) is among the grains with highest protein content. It is also
high in fiber and contains many essential vitamins and minerals. In authentic recipe
rice is used, which has been replaced by Freekeh over here, which is the latest
addition to the category of super-foods. Freekeh is a wheat grain harvested while young
and green. It is obtained by roasting the harvested grain over the open fire and then
removing the burned straw and chaff from it. Freekeh is high in fiber, proteins,
calcium, lutein (for eye health) and low in available carbs. Not to mention, the
addition of all the mix-vegetables add to the overall nutritional value of the dish

              <h2 style="color:#f64c72;"> HISTORY</h2>
              <p>

                Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.) originated in tropical western
Africa some 4000 years ago. From there, it divided into globossum race and moved to
western side, and a new race typhoid also appeared that reached eastern Africa and
travelled to India and southern Africa about 2000–3000 years ago (Vilas et al.,
2015). In between 3000 and 2500 BC, pearl millet spread rapidly to African
countries through pastoralists, spurred by the increasing desiccation of the Sahara
desert at that time. Vavilov in his classic work on ‘Origins of Crops’ allotted
pearl millet on the Ethiopian centre of domestication, the ancient highlands of 
Ethiopia are modern agriculturally diverse region in which crops from many parts of
the world are continuously grown successfully (Vavilov, 1926). There are two
evidences which argue against an Ethiopian origin of pearl millet. First, the wild
progenitor (Pennisetum americanum subsp. monodii) is rare east of Sudan and has
never been collected in the Ethiopian highlands. Wild progenitor is adapted to the
sandy semi-arid conditions of the Sahel and very likely would have been absent from
the high rainfall and high altitude environment of the Ethiopian highlands.
Secondly, the pearl millet of Ethiopia lacks sufficient morphological diversity.
Now days, pearl millet is a minor crop in Ethiopia and is probably the product of
post domestication introduction. A second theory as to the origin of pearl millet
was proposed by Mudrock (1959). As per initial linguistic evidence, he proposed
that pearl millet was one of the several West African crops domesticated by Mande
people near the head waters of the Niger River between 4000 and 5000 BC. The
general hypothesis postulated by Mudrock (1959) has been the centre of considerable
controversy since its publication (Brunken et al., 1977). During the period
suggested by Mudrock, the head waters of the Niger probably exhibited a climax,
tropical rain forest type of vegetation.
