the ragi slurry, do stir it once or twice in the bowl.
 Keeping the flame to a low, mix the ragi slurry in the hot boiling water with a wired
whisk or spoon.
 Simmer and cook on a low flame.
 In between do stir at intervals with a wired whisk or spoon.
 The mixture will thicken gradually.
Overall cook for 10 to 12 minutes after adding the ragi slurry. the mixture will
thicken more by this time. Before proceeding to the next step, the ragi should be
completely cooked. There should be no rawness in the taste. You can take a bit of the
mixture in a spoon and taste it to check the raw taste.
 making ragi malt
 In this next step, add 6 tablespoons jaggery or add as per taste. You can even add
sugar. Sweeteners like jaggery or sugar can also be skipped entirely for a diabetic
friendly option.
Mix again very well till all the jaggery gets dissolved. If in case the ragi porridge
becomes thick then add some more water.
 Add ¼ teaspoon cardamom powder and 1 tablespoon chopped cashews.
 You can even use chopped almonds. For small kids or toddlers, you can use blanched
almond powder. Various dry fruits and nuts or nut powder of your choice can be added.
 Mix very well. Please do note that this porridge will thicken more on cooling.
 Serve ragi malt hot or warm or at room temperature.
<h4>Note</h4>
 More or less of jaggery or sugar can be added.
 Depending on the quality of ragi flour, you can add less or more water.
 For a thinner ragi malt, add more water and for a thick ragi porridge add less water.
 The recipe can be halved, doubled or tripled easily.
 You can add various nuts, dry fruits and flavorings of your choice.
If you prefer, you can add half-half of water or milk or only milk in the malt.
Skip jaggery or sugar entirely for diabetics.
Both ragi flour and sprouted ragi flour can be used to make this ragi malt recipe.
