              <p>
                Foxtail millet, scientific name Setaria italica, is an annual grass
grown for human food. It is the second-most widely planted species of millet, and
the most grown millet species in Asia. The oldest evidence of foxtail millet
cultivation was found along the ancient course of the Yellow River in Cishan,
China, carbon dated to be from around 8,000 years before present.Foxtail millet has
also been grown in India since antiquity.It is also Called As Makra & Murat in
Hindi and korrelu in telugu.

<h2 style="color:#f64c72;">History</h2>
<p>The earliest evidence for foxtail millet cultivation outside of its
native distribution is at Chengtoushan in the Middle Yangtze River region, dating
to around 4000 BC. In southern China, foxtail millet reached the Chengdu Plain
(Baodun) at around 2700 BC and Guangxi (Gantuoyan [de], near the Vietnamese
border) at around 3000 BC.Foxtail millet also reached Taiwan (Nankuanli, Dapenkeng
culture) at around 2800 BC and the Tibetan Plateau (Karuo) at around 3000 BC.
Foxtail millet likely reached Southeast Asia via multiple routes. The earliest
evidence for foxtail millet in Southeast Asia comes from various sites in the Khao
Wong Prachan Valley in central Thailand, with the site at Non Pa Wai [de] providing
the earliest date with direct AMS dating to around 2300 BC.
35 The earliest evidence for foxtail millet in East Siberia comes from the
archaeological site at Krounovka 1 in Primorsky Krai, dating to around
3620–3370 BC. The earliest direct evidence for foxtail millet in Korea
come from Dongsam-dong Shell Midden, a Jeulmun site in southern Korea,
with a direct AMS date of around 3,360 BC. In Japan, the earliest
evidence for foxtail millet comes from the Jōmon site at Usujiri in
Hokkaido, dating to around 4,000 BP.
36 Foxtail millet arrived in Europe later; carbonized seeds first appear in
the second millennium BC in central Europe. The earliest definite
evidence for its cultivation in the Near East is at the Iron Age levels
at Tille Hoyuk in Turkey, with an uncorrected radiocarbon date of about
600 BC.

              <h2 style="color:#f64c72;">INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
              <p>
                Start by washing the Foxtail Millet under running tap water, rinsing and then soaking
it for 15 to 20 minutes, until the prep work is done.
 Heat 1 tbsp oil in a kadhai, add 1 tsp chana dal, 1/8 tsp mustard seeds and 3-4 nos.
whole red chillies. Allow the mustard to crackle, add a pinch of asafoetida or hing.
 Now add the grated carrots (1/2 cup) and fresh or frozen green peas (1/2 cup). Saute
them on low heat for a few seconds.
 Add grated ginger, finely chopped green chillies and curry leaves.
 Now add 1/4 tsp Turmeric Powder or haldi and salt to taste. Mix well.
 Add the soaked Foxtail Millet to the vegetable mixture. Mix Well.
 Allow to cook for a few minutes until the water evaporates. Transfer this to a pressure cooker vessel and add water (1 cup millets : 1 1/2 cup
Water). Mix well and cover with lid. Pressure cook for 4 whistles.
 Once pressure is released, remove the vessel from the pressure cooker and open the lid.
Use a fork to mix. Delicious Foxtail Millet Upma is ready to serve with an
accompaniment of your choice.
 Notes
 This can be easily made in a pan too and doesn't need a pressure cooker, if you don't
have one. Just follow all the steps upto adding the soaked millets and allowing the
water to evaporate. Now add water to the kadhai and cover with a lid. Allow to cook on
low heat until done.
 The recipe is vegan but not gluten free as I have added asafoetida or hing. You can
skip the same or use alternative.
 You can serve this Upma with a dollop of ghee, would taste amazing!
 In case you are in a hurry and have not soaked the millets, just wash it a couple of
times, rinse and while pressure cooking, add 1/2 cup extra water.
Add any vegetables of your choice for this recipe. I have added seasonal vegetables
like carrots and peas. You can add bell peppers, boiled corn, broccoli, cauliflower,
beans etc.
I tend to add a little extra turmeric powder in most of my recipes as I love the
ingredient. You can add any home made masala too to this Upma. Garam Masala would be a
good choice.
I have kept this recipe No Onion No Garlic. You can add chopped onions after the
mustard seeds have crackled and the chana dal has roasted."
